This is my first post on Props in ReactJS! How exciting!

<!-- import React, { useEffect, useContext } from "react"
import { Link } from "react-router-dom"
import DispatchContext from "../DispatchContext"
import StateContext from "../StateContext"

function HeaderLoggedIn(props) {
const appDispatch = useContext(DispatchContext)
const appState = useContext(StateContext)
function handleLogout() {
appDispatch({ type: "logout" })
}
return (
<div className="flex-row my-3 my-md-0">
<a href="#" className="text-white mr-2 header-search-icon">
<i className="fas fa-search"></i>
</a>
<span className="mr-2 header-chat-icon text-white">
<i className="fas fa-comment"></i>
<span className="chat-count-badge text-white"> </span>
</span>
<Link to={`/profile/${appState.user.username}`} className="mr-2">
<img className="small-header-avatar" src={appState.user.avatar} />
</Link>
<Link className="btn btn-sm btn-success mr-2" to="/create-post">
Create Post
</Link>
<button onClick={handleLogout} className="btn btn-sm btn-secondary">
Sign Out
</button>
</div>
)
}

export default HeaderLoggedIn -->

I'm sure I'll write a lot more interesting things in the future.

Oh, and here's a great quote from this Wikipedia on
[salted duck eggs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salted_duck_egg).

> A salted duck egg is a Chinese preserved food product made by soaking duck
> eggs in brine, or packing each egg in damp, salted charcoal. In Asian
> supermarkets, these eggs are sometimes sold covered in a thick layer of salted
> charcoal paste. The eggs may also be sold with the salted paste removed,
> wrapped in plastic, and vacuum packed. From the salt curing process, the
> salted duck eggs have a briny aroma, a gelatin-like egg white and a
> firm-textured, round yolk that is bright orange-red in color.
