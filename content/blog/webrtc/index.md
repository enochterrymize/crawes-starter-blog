#webrtc

### Is a framework that enables real time communication on web, browser, and mobile application.

> webrtc stands for WEB REAL TIME COMMUNICATION.

### WEBRTC Steps:

- Signalling
- Connecting
- Securing
- Communicating

> Communication using WEBRTC is most of the time Peer to Peer.

WEBRTC uses some many technologies.

> HTML,CSS, Javascript, NodeJS, Computer Network.

## Why WebRTC ?

Communication before webrtc, server does all the job. server as to do all the job. server way of doing is not scalable.

How do we make peer to peer ? Its also bring privacy. We can elimminate server cost.

Technology - SERVER

TEXT, Files, Video and Audio

### How WEBRTC works ?

We need to establish peer to peer connection.

Ech router as public IP. IP address

what is my IP Address is ?

when two people wants to communicate they need to know each other PUBLIC ip address.

## SIGNALLING SERVERLESS

It use to exchange ip address and connection between two people. Type of the call also passed by signalling server, it triggers the whole webrtc process.

Each device as own private Ip address.

STUN Server - It tells and finds your device public ip addresss

TURN SERVER - Incase if it is not connecting via peer to peer. there TURN SERVER works. TURN server is backup server. TURN SERVER works as traditional server.

### Websockets

Technology called websockets, websocket can also used to implement signalling server.

Normal Communication

###websocket
Client request and Server Reponse, but in case of chat we need instance communication, basically there is a link between them is bidrectional, this link is websocket. Basically establishing bidirectional commuinication with other entity, it can server or peer.

```
Install Node js

node -v

node

```
